### Minerals and Plants

**Research has shown that certain minerals are required by plants for normal growth and development.** **The soil is the source of these minerals**, which are absorbed by the plant with the water from the soil. **Even nitrogen**, which is a gas in its elemental state, **is normally absorbed from the soil as nitrate ions**. **Some soils are notoriously deficient in micro nutrients and are therefore unable to support most plant life.** **So-called serpentine soils**, for example, **are deficient in calcium, and only plants able to tolerate low levels of this mineral can survive.** In modern agriculture, **mineral depletion of soils is a major concern**, since harvesting crops interrupts the recycling of nutrients back to the soil.

>serpentine 	adj 弯弯曲曲的；阴险的

>depletion	   n 耗尽

>研究表明：某些化学五十在植物的生长和发育中是必须的。土壤就是这些化学物质的源头，植物通过吸收土壤中的水分来吸收化学物质。即使是像氮这样的元素状态是气体的元素，也通常是以硝酸盐离子的形式从土壤中被吸收。一些土壤总所周知是缺乏微量营养物的，因此不能去支持大多数植物的生命。例如 SS，缺乏钙，只有能忍受低浓度钙的植物才能生存。 在现代农业中，土壤矿物质的好近是一个巨大的问题，因为丰收的农作物打断了营养物质回到土壤的循环。

**Mineral deficiencies can often be detected by specific symptoms** such as chlorosis (loss of chlorophyll resulting in yellow or white leaf tissue), necrosis (isolated dead patches), anthocyanin formation (development of deep red pigmentation of leaves or stem), stunted growth, and development of woody tissue in an herbaceous plant. **Soils are most commonly deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus.** **Nitrogen-deficient plants exhibit many of the symptoms just described**. **Leaves develop chlorosis**; **stems are short and slender**, **and anthocyanin discoloration occurs on stems, petioles, and lower leaf surfaces.** **Phosphorus-deficient plants are often stunted**, with leaves turning a characteristic dark green, often with the accumulation of anthocyanin. Typically, **older leaves are affected first as the phosphorus is mobilized to young growing tissue. Iron deficiency is characterized by chlorosis between veins in young leaves.**

>stunt adj 发育不良的

>vein adj 叶脉

>矿物质的缺乏经常被一些特殊的症状所显示，例如ch（缺少ch导致叶子发黄变白），ne，an等等。 土壤经常缺乏氮和磷。缺乏氮的植物显现出很多刚刚描述的症状。叶子变黄，梗变得短小脆弱，an 发生在叶梗等更低的叶子表面。磷缺乏的植物通常发育不良。叶子呈现暗绿色，通常积累a。显然，老得叶子会先被磷所影响，因为磷被转移到了年轻的生长的叶子。铁缺乏会呈现新叶间叶脉白化。

**Much of the research on nutrient deficiencies is based on growing plants hydroponically,** that is, in soilless liquid nutrient solutions. **This technique allows researchers to create solutions that selectively omit certain nutrients and then observe the resulting effects on the plants.** **Hydroponics has applications beyond basic research**, since it facilitates the growing of greenhouse vegetables during winter. **Aeroponics**, a technique in which plants are suspended and the roots misted with a nutrient solution, **is another method for growing plants without soil.**

>hydroponics.  溶液栽培

>omit 删掉 漏掉

>mist  n 水汽，迷雾。adj  被迷雾包围 ，模糊不清的 v 对喷雾

>很多关于营养缺乏的研究是鉴于溶液栽培植物，这是一种无土液体营养溶液。 这个技术使得研究者创造一个溶液，其中的某些营养物质是被选择性的删除的，然后观察对于植物的影响。溶液在被有有着超过基础研究的应用。因为它促进了温室植物在冬季的生长。 A，一个植物被挂起，根筋膜在营养液中的技术。是另一个无土栽培的方法。

While mineral deficiencies can limit the growth of plants, **an overabundance of certain minerals can be toxic and can also limit growth.** **Saline soils**, which have high concentrations of sodium chloride and other salts, **limit plant growth**, and **research continues to focus on developing salt-tolerant varieties of agricultural crops**. **Research has focused on the toxic effects of heavy metals** such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and aluminum; however, **even copper and zinc**, which are essential elements, **can become toxic in high concentrations.** **Although most plants cannot survive in these soils**, **certain plants have the ability to tolerate high levels of these minerals**.

>虽然矿物质的缺失可以限制植物的生长。但是过于丰富的某些矿物质可能产生不良影响，也能限制生长。含盐溶液，有高浓度的氯化物，可以限制植物生长。研究持续关注培养抗盐的农作物种类。研究已经关注一些重金属的有害的影响例如铅，镉，镁，铝。然而，即使是铜和锌，那些必须元素，在高浓度的情况下依旧会变得有害。 虽然大多数植物不能在这种土壤中生存下来，但是还是有些植物有能力忍受高浓度的矿物质。

**Scientists have known for some time that certain plants**, called hyperaccumulators, **can concentrate minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than normal**. **A survey of known hyperaccumulators identified that 75 percent of them amassed nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese, lead, and cadmium are other minerals of choice.** **Hyperaccumulators run the entire range of the plant world.** **They may be herbs, shrubs, or trees.** **Many members  of the mustard family, spurge family, legume family, and grass family are top hyperaccumulators.** **Many are found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world**, where accumulation of high concentrations of metals may afford some protection against plant-eating insects and microbial pathogens.

>科学家已经知道某些植物，能够聚集矿物质某种程度上百倍于平常。一个知名的ha表明，百分之75的聚集n，c，c,z,m,l。 Ha 存在于整个植物世界。他们可能是草本植物，灌木，或者树，大多是芥末家族，，，，，是顶级的超聚集者。很多被发现于热带亚热带的地区，那儿聚集高浓度的矿物质可能踢空一些保护，抵抗植食性捆葱和微生物。

**Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to clean up soil and waste sites** that have been contaminated by toxic levels of heavy metals–an environmentally friendly approach known as phytoremediation. **This scenario begins with the planting of hyperaccumulating species in the target area,** such as an abandoned mine or an irrigation pond contaminated by runoff. **Toxic minerals would first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the stem and leaves.** **A harvest of the shoots would remove the toxic compounds off site to be burned or composted to recover the metal for industrial uses.** After several years of cultivation and harvest, **the site would be restored at a cost much lower than the price of excavation and reburial, the standard practice for remediation of contaminated soils.** **For examples, in field trials, the plant alpine pennycress removed zinc and cadmium from soils near a zinc smelter, and Indian mustard, native to Pakistan and India, has been effective in reducing levels of selenium salts by 50 percent in contaminated soils.**

>只有最近调查者们考虑使用这些植物区清理土壤和荒野，那些已经被有毒的高浓度的金属污染了的土地。作为一种环保的方法。这个剧情随着在目标地区种植超聚集物种的植物而开始。有毒的矿物质将会首先被根吸收，但是之后转移到叶梗和叶子上。种植的结果是从这些地方移除了有毒的化合物，这些将会被燃烧或者堆肥去补充工业用途的金属。经过几年的培养和收获，这个地方将会被一个很低的价格修复。例如，在试验田中，高山植物P 从锌熔炉中移除了锌和钙。印度芥末，生长在P和I，可以减少污染土地中50%的锡盐。

**A/D: **

*in order to attract tourists, government should improve safety by hiring police rather than
improve appearance by repairing old buildings and streets. (2015.9.5ML)* 

**CONTENT**

To bring more tourists to the city sounds quite simple, but there has been no single way where the effect can be ensured. Some policy makers believe that mission can be accomplished if government can **ramp up** police security. Sure, safety is clearly important, but I think people will **be better served with** renovation of buildings and streets. 

> 为了带来更多的消费者听起来十分容易，但是这没有单一的一个方法来起到作用。一些政策制定者认为如果政府提高警力安全，就可以达到带来更多游客的效果。 的确，安全毫无疑问是重要的，但是我认为，人们应该更加受益于街道和建筑的翻新。

> it is sound quite easy to bring more tourist. but there is no single way can be in effect.  Some policy maker think that if goveronment **ramp up** policy security ,there will be more tourist  in the city. Definitely,  the security is very important. But in my opinion, people will **be better served with ** renovation of buildings and streets.

**First off**, renovating streets makes the destination accessible to more holiday-makers. No matter how attractive the scenic spot is, without adequate transportation tourists will **be kept at bay**. Inter-city highways, region-connected roads and bus terminals all provide external access to the spot. But the truth is most tourist attractions are far from major urban hubs, and demand plenty of time and money to reach. To **wrestle with** jammed traffic would be the last thing to expect for someone on a vacation. So if the government could fund the road renovation program, cabs full of tourists won’t **clog up the streets**. Plus, developing transport links with site-packed itineraries and reducing prices are all tourist-friendly. strategies to take the game to the next level. For travelers on a budget, affordable road trip would **hold the key to** their choices of destination. 

>首先,翻新街道可以使更多的景点对更多的度假者开放。无论这个景点有多么吸引人， 没有足够的交通运输能力，游客们寸步难行，城市间的高速，地区间的公路，公共汽车站点都提供去景点的方式。但是事实是很多景点都远离主要的城区中心，需要很多的时间和金钱去抵达。全力应付拥挤的交通是度假者最不期望的事情，所以如果政府能够资助道路的翻新工程，载满游客的出租车将不会拥堵接街道。另外，有关景点套餐行程的交通的发展和价格的减少都对游客十分的友好。良好的政策可以将事情提升一个等级。对于拮据的旅游者，可负担的道路费用将对于他们目的地的选择非常重要。

>First of all, the renovation of street can more tourist can reach more far sites.  No matter how  attractive this scenic spot is. Without enough routes and transportation, travellers will **be kept at bay**.Inter-city highways, region-connected roads and bus terminals can help travellers to reach the spots. But , the truth is most famous sites are far away from the center of city. it will take lots of time and money to arrive at the spots. Trying themself to  face the traffic jam is not expected for tourists. So if goveronment could  support the renovation of street . There is no taxi full of travellers crowed in the streets . Additionally, Developing the pakage-routes and reducing prices are all  firendly with tourist.Beneficial policy will improve these game to next level. For travellers on budget, affordable road trip will make sense in their choices of destination

Besides, restoring historical buildings creates new tourist attractions. 

The recent decades has witnessed a growing number of tourist attractions **such as restored temples, reopened silk museums and renovated Imperial Gardens**. These sites can not only attract domestic tourists but also satisfy the demands of international holiday-makers. Sometimes people build modern skyscrapers, assuming they are going to attract global attention. However, *if you **take a closer look**, you can see that **it is not the case** for someone who loves to travel.* It is buildings with a story to tell and a past to relate to that **makes the journey worthwhile**. So when government can focus on restoring and refurbishing old buildings we already have, tourists will take a new interest in checking it out.

>除此之外，翻新历史性建筑可以增加新的旅游吸引力。最近几十年已经见证了大量旅游景点的增长例如修复的古庙，重开的丝绸之路博物馆，翻新的皇室花园。这些景点不仅可以吸引国内的游客，同时也可以满足国际度假者的需求。有时候人们建造现代的摩天大楼，假定他们可以吸引全球的目光。 但是如果你仔细想想，你能看到对于喜欢旅行的人不是这种情况。只有有着故事和历史的建筑才能使得这段旅程变得有价值。因此当政府关注于修复我们已有的古建筑，游客们才有新的兴趣去游览他们。

>Besides, renovating the historical sites can facilitate new tourist attractions. Recent decents years ago , there is quite increasing of  scenic spot such as restored temples , reopened silk museums and renovated imperial garden. Not only do these sites draw attention from demostic travellers , but they also can meet the demand of international holiday-makers. In order to attract global attention , people build  modern skyscrapers.  But you think twice, for those who truely love travelling , it is not the case. Only with own historical story and past do the attractions can make the trip worthwhile. Therefore , when government can restore the historical sites which we have had , travellers can have new interest in checking them out.

It is not to say safety issues are trivial. Low **crime rate** and good **social order** do **rank high on the list of** tourist destinations. After all, crime-infested areas would hardly arouse any interest. **Theft, robbery or even terrorist attack** would totally ruined the whole trip. But let’s put tourism aside, providing security and **fighting against** crimes are a fundamental need. **It is an obligation government shoulders to guarantee** the basic life standards of locals. But **in terms of** boosting tourism, it is the adequate transportation and high-quality tourist attractions that help the government **gain momentum**. 

>当然，并不是说安全问题不重要。 低的犯罪率和良好的社会秩序的确对于旅游业很重要。毕竟犯罪率高的地方很难引发任何兴趣。盗窃，抢劫，甚至恐怖袭击将会完全的毁灭整个旅行。但是让我们先把旅游放到一边，保证安全打击犯罪是一个基本的需求。保证当地人基本的生活标准是政府的责任和担当。但是当谈到快速发展旅游业。只有足够的交通设施和高质量的旅游景点才能帮助政府获得动力。

After all,  it is hard for travellers to interest in a city which is crime-infested. Theft , robbery and even terrorist attack may completely ruin the whole trip.However, let's put the tourism aside.

It is only adequate transportation and high-quality tourist attractions that can help gavernment to gain momentum.
