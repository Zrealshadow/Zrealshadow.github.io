### 独立写作Q1

A/D:The government can take a variety of actions to help protect the environment.Which one of the following do you think is the most important for the nation's government to take to protect the enviroment.

1.Fund the research to develop environmentally friendly energy sources such as solar and wind energy.

2.Preserve the natural places like forests and protect the animals that live there.

3.Enforce laws to prevent the pollution of air and water by large companies.



In terms of the actions of the government to help protect the environment, someone may agree that governments can support the research of recycling energy to protect the environment, others may think that  protecting the natural places can make sense. However, I quite suggest governments to enforce laws to limit the emission of contaminants of large companies.

>actions **used by** government

>污染物：  pollutants / contaminant

First off,  In my opinion, the laws to prevent the pollution is the most efficient and direct method. ~~Among the pollution to the environment, what are produced by large companies are the majority.~~<u>The mission of pollution by large companies make up the majority of all contaminants</u> Compared to the  waste from the large companies, <u>the number of</u> the daily garbages from citizens are relatively trivial. Take the city I live,Beijing, as an example. A few years ago, there were many factories located in the rural area of beijing city. Every time I passed through the suburbs of Beijing, I could see the plant of high towers standing together and constantly releasing smoke.  If you opened the window of the car, the air is too way dirty to breath for people. Additionally, without limitations of governments, ~~it was common that industries drain sewage into the river directly~~. <u>Draining sewage into the river directly is a common practice for these factories.</u> As a result, ~~the weather in Beijing was extremely bad. It reached a degree that people had to wear a mask when they wanted to go out to the street~~.<u>The air is so bad that people had to wear a mask when they wanted to go out to the street</u>. Finally, the government of Beijing started to concentrate on this problem. With some policies published to limit the emission of pollution, the companies had to satisfy the requirment of the government quickly. Some illegal companies were even demolished. Then, the environment of Beijing soon got better obviously.<u>the environment of Beijing  was cosiderably enhanced soon</u>

Besides, if the government enforce the laws to protect the environment, it is a good represent to appeal to more local citizens to join in the environmental protection. The behaviors of the government can express that governments pay much attention to preserving the environment, which will effectively enhance people's awareness of environmental pretection. In daily life, dwellings may try to reduce the waste , to not drop garbages randomly, even to classify them. Some environmentally friendly institutions might introduce the low-carbon life to local people and organize some volunteering activities like planting trees and clearing the trash on the street. 

>关注 focus on/ pay attention to/ fixate on/ concentrate on
>
>唤起 arouse attention / awareness

Sure, it is not to say that the first method and the second method are trivial.  Funding the research of new energy can solve the pollution completely in the future. A new clean/eco-friendly energy can gaurantee a clear and bright life in ten or twenty years. However, it can not deal with the current issues.<展开>  preserving the natural places and protecting the habitats of animals can limit the damage to the environment. Nevertheless, It can not help the protection fundamentally <展开>.  Compared to these two solutions, the final method is a better choice for governments.<解释 展开>



To sum up, because of the efficiency and influence of the third method, In order to protect the environment, I am all for that government should enforce laws to prevent the pollution of air and water from companies.

### 独立写作Q2

A/D:People are now easier to become educated than in the past. Do you agree or disagree.



I definitely support the statement that it is easier for people to be educated  than in the past. In the past My grandparents always told me that in their age his friends and family had to give up studying for lack of money ~~to afford the tuition~~ and for deficient  education resources. However, today these factors are no longer barriers for us to study.

>时代： age/era
>
>上学 schooling



First off,  Beside the tranditional educational Pattern, where you should go to school, attend class , listen carefully to what teachers say and take notes about the key points, there are many ways available to acquire and record knowledge now. Because of the invention of electronical devices and Internet, we come into a period of information explosion.it is not tough to get the education resources any more. On the Internet, the search engines like Google and Bings will give you what you want to know when you print the key words and simply click on the button. some educational websites offer people free online courses that include various disciplines. some experts share their learning experience and new ideas in their own blog to all people. Not only can you learn something from what teachers say and what the books show, but you can also attend the online course and browse the electronic books in the moblie phone wherever and whenever is needed.<record 展开>

>包含： include / involve/ consist of
>
>意见领袖  Key opinion leader
>
>无论何时/无论何地
>
>Any where and any time
>
>Wherever and whenever you like
>
>Causer

Additionally, with the development of economy, all families are becoming more wealthy. As the saying goes, education is the best investment. So an increasing number of parents are paying attention to their children's education. Consequently, the education industry becomes very prosperous. Parents can hire various tutors to design a detailed and personal plan for their chidren. Most of tutoring classes are affordable. Plus, govenments also quite concentrate on the education. Take my country ,China, as an example. On the one hand, it offers 9 years free fundamental education for all children. So we can smoothly enter the high school without spending few money. Some people may say that the fees of university is increasing and people may can't afford this money. However, to **reduce the occurance of this situation**, the government will distribute a large mount of money to sponsor poor freshman in the university every year. Thus, if you have determination and persistence, there is no barrier for you to study. Even if you have good talents and want to get further research. Some relevant program can provide financial aid to you to study abroad.

>tailor a plan 定制一个计划，量身制定一个计划
>
>今昔对比 万能理由：
>
>科技/环境/观念/政府福利
>
>义务教育：compulsory education from grade one to grade nine
>
>学费： fee
>
>分配 ： distribute /allocate



In conclusion, Education is more accessiable with the invention of internet, And the financial problem is not a main obstacle for people any more for the funding of governments. So I believe that people are more easier to become educated than in the past.

### Infantile Amnesia

>infantile  adj 婴儿的 孩子气的
>
>amnesia n 遗忘症

What do you remember about your life before you were three? **Few people can remember anything that happened to them in their early years**. **Adults' memories of the next few years also tend to be scanty. Most people remember only a few events—usually ones that were meaningful and distinctive,** such as being hospitalized or a sibling’s birth.

>Scanty adj 量少的/ 不足的 b奥卢的
>
>你能记得你三岁之前的生活么。几乎没有人能记起早些年发生在他们身上的任何事情。成年人的对于接下来几年的记忆一般很少。 大多数人只记得非常有意义和特别的几件事情。例如入院治疗或兄弟生日。

How might this inability to recall early experiences be explained? **The sheer passage of time does not account for it**; **adults have excellent recognition of pictures of people** who attended high school with them 35 years earlier. **Another seemingly plausible explanation**—that infants do not form enduring memories at this point in development—also **is incorrect**. **Children two and a half to three years old remember experiences that occurred in their first year**, and **eleven month olds remember some events a year later.** **Nor does the hypothesis that infantile amnesia reflects repression—or holding back—of sexually charged episodes explain the phenomenon**. While such repression may occur, **people cannot remember ordinary events from the infant and toddler periods either**.

>sheer 	adj	十足的/完全的/陡峭的/轻薄的
>
>plausible	adj  花言巧语的/貌似合理的
>
>enduring 	adj 持续的
>
>episode  n 一件/一集/
>
>toddler	n	学步儿童
>
>这种不能想起以前经历的现象要怎么解释呢？纯粹的时间流逝不能解释它。成年人有着卓越的对人类图像的辨识能力。另一个似乎合理的解释是新生儿在那个发育的阶段没有形成持续的记忆。 但是这个解释也是不正确的。2岁半到三岁的儿童记得他们一岁的事情。11月大的孩子已的一年后的事情。婴儿遗忘症反应压力的假设也不能解释这个现象。但是当这样的压力可能出现，人们也不能记得婴儿时期的普通事情了。

**Three other explanations seem more promising**. **One involves physiological changes relevant to memory. Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain continues throughout early childhood, and this part of the brain may be critical for remembering particular episodes in ways** that can be retrieved later. **Demonstrations of infants’and toddlers' long-term memory have involved their repeating motor activities that they had seen or done earlier**, such as reaching in the dark for objects, putting a bottle in a doll’s mouth, or pulling apart two pieces of a toy. **The brain’s level of physiological maturation may support these types of memories, but not ones requiring explicit verbal descriptions.**

>Maturation	n 	成熟
>
>frontal	adj	正面的/前额的
>
>lobe	n 耳垂/叶
>
>retrieve	adj 取回/检索/纠正/挽回
>
>demonstration n 示范操作/表达/游行
>
>explicit	adj 详细的/明确的/直接了当的
>
>三个其他的解释可能更有前景。一个关于和记忆相关的物理变化。大脑前叶的成熟在早期童年的过程中持续，大脑的这一部分可能对于记忆一些之后可能被检索的事情有着至关重要的作用。婴儿长期记忆表现在他们重复之前见过或者做过的运动活动。例如在黑暗中寻找物体，把一个瓶子放在娃娃嘴里，或者将玩具拆成两半。大脑物理成熟的程度可能支持这一类的记忆，但是没有一种需要明确的口头描述。

**A second explanation involves the influence of the social world on children’s language use.** **Hearing and telling stories about events may help children store information in ways** that will endure into later childhood and adulthood. **Through hearing stories with a clear beginning, middle, and ending children may learn to extract the gist of events in ways** that they will be able to describe many years later. **Consistent with this view, parents and children increasingly engage in discussions of past events** when children are about three years old. However, **hearing such stories is not sufficient for younger children to form enduring memories. Telling such stories to two year olds does not seem to produce long-lasting verbalizable memories.**

>extract  v 取出/跳出/获得/提取/摘录
>
>gist	n 	主旨
>
>第二个解释关于社会世界对于儿童语言运用的影响。听和谁某些事情可能对于小孩储存信息有帮助，用这种方法信息肯能一直持续到儿童晚期和成年时期。虽然听有明确开头，中间，结尾的故事，小孩可能学会去提取时间的主旨，用这种方法他们能够描述这件事在多年之后。与这个观点一致的是，当小孩三岁之后家长和小孩开始大量讨论过去的事情。但是，听这样的故事对于年轻的小孩形成持续的记忆是不足的。给2岁的小孩说这样的故事似乎也不能形成长期持续的口头记忆。

**A third likely explanation for infantile amnesia involves incompatibilities between the ways in which infants encode information and the ways in which older children and adults retrieve it.** **Whether people can remember an event depends critically on the fit between the way in which they earlier encoded the information and the way in which they later attempt to retrieve it.** **The better able the person is to reconstruct the perspective from which the material was encoded, the more likely that recall will be successful.**

>incompatibility	n	矛盾/不和睦/不协调/不一致
>
>第三个可能的对于儿童遗忘症的解释关于婴儿解构信息的方式和长大之后人们回想的方式的矛盾。人们能否想起一件事情很大程度上取决于 他之前编码信息的方式和之后他试图去检索信息的方式之间的契合度。人们去从编码材料中重建观点的能力越强，会想就越容易成功。

**This view is supported by a variety of factors** that can create mismatches between very young children's encoding and older children's and adults' retrieval efforts. **The world looks very different to a person** whose head is only two or three feet above the ground **than to one** whose head is five or six feet above it. **Older children and adults often try to retrieve the names of things they saw,** **but infants would not have encoded the information verbally.** **General knowledge of categories of events** such as a birthday party or a visit to the doctor's office **helps older individuals encode their experiences**, but again, **infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode many experiences within such knowledge structures.**

>这个观点被许多种类的恶因素支持，它们能在新生儿的编码和长大之后的回想之间创造不匹配。在头部只有2，3英尺高的人和头部有5，6英尺高的人看起来是完全不同的。大一点的孩子和成人经常是土去互相它们所看的事物的名字，但是婴儿时没能口头地编码信息。例如生日派对或者去看医生等活动类别的一般了解有助于年长的人编码它们的经历，但是婴儿和小孩不经常在这样的知识结构下编码他们的经历。

**These three explanations of infantile amnesia are not mutually exclusive**; indeed, **they support each other**. **Physiological immaturity may be part of why infants and toddlers do not form extremely enduring memories**, even when they hear stories that promote such remembering in preschoolers. **Hearing the stories may lead preschoolers to encode aspects of events that allow them to form memories they can access as adults.** **Conversely, improved encoding of what they hear may help them better understand and remember stories and thus make the stories more useful for remembering future events**. Thus**, all three explanations—physiological maturation, hearing and producing stories about past events, and improved encoding of key aspects of events—seem likely to be involved in overcoming infantile amnesia.**

>exclusive adj 高档的/独有的/唯一的
>
>着三个对于婴儿遗忘症的解释不是相互排斥的；确实，它们相互支持，生理上的不成熟可能解释为什么婴儿不能建立较持久的记忆。听车鞋故事可能导致学龄前的儿童编码部分事件，让他们建立它们成年之后能触及的记忆。相反，提升后的对于听到事情的编码可能帮助他们更好的理解记忆事情，因此使得故事对于记忆未来的事情变得更加有用。因此，所有的三个解释似乎都对攻克婴儿遗忘症有作用。
