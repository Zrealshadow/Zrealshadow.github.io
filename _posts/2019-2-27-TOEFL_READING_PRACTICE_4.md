# Deer Populations of the Puget Sound

**Two species of deer have been prevalent in the Puget Sound area of Washington State in the Pacific Northwest of the United States**. **The black-tailed deer**, a lowland, west-side cousin of the mule deer of eastern Washington, **is now the most common**. **The other species**, the Columbian white-tailed deer, **in earlier times was common in the open prairie country**; **it is now restricted to the low, marshy islands and flood plains along the lower Columbia River.**

>在美国的太平洋西北方向，华盛顿州的P海湾，两个种类的鹿已经变得十分常见，黑尾鹿现在是最常见的。另一个种类的鹿，哥伦比亚白尾鹿在早些时候在开阔的大草原的乡下是非常常见的额。但是现在已经被限制在了沿着低矮哥伦比亚河的低矮的沼泽的岛屿和大量的平原。

N**early any kind of plant of the forest understory can be part of a deer's diet**. Where the forest inhibits the growth of grass and other meadow plants, **the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other shrub or herb**. But **this is fair-weather feeding**. **What keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant decay and dormancy?** **One compensation for not hibernating is the built-in urge to migrate**. **Deer may move from high-elevation browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall**. Even with snow on the ground, **the high bushy understory is exposed**; also **snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red alder, and other arboreal fodder**.

**The numbers of deer  have fluctuated markedly** since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound country. **The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath bemoaned the lack of this succulent game animal**. **Famous explorers of the north American frontier,** Lewis and Clark **arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14, 1805**, in nearly starved circumstances. **They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the second of December did they kill their first elk**. To keep 40 people alive that winter, **they consumed approximately 150 elk and 20 deer**. And when game moved out of the lowlands in early spring, **the expedition decided to return east rather than face possible starvation**. Later on in the early years of the nineteenth century, when Fort Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company, **deer populations continued to fluctuate**. **David Douglas**, Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s**, found a disturbing change in the animal life** around the fort during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final contact with the fort in 1832. A recent **Douglas biographer states:' The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the fort were gone [in 1832], hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops.'**

>从欧洲人进入P海湾之后，鹿的数量有着显著的波动。早期的探险家和定居者说在19世纪有很多很多鹿，但是几乎在一瞬间哀叹缺乏这种鲜美多汁的动物。有名的探险家，L和C在1805 11 14日到达哥伦比亚河口，在几乎饿急了的情况下。他们经历了一个十分困难的寻找动物的过程，在落基山脉以西。知道 12月2号，他们才杀了他们的第一头驼鹿。为了让40个人在冬天存活下来，他们大约消费了150头驼鹿和20头鹿。当猎物们移出了低地在早春时候，探险家们决定返回东边而不是面对可能的饥饿。19书籍早期，当FV变成了H公司的司令，鹿的数量持续波动。DD发现了动物中令人不安的变化。DD的自传中说道：那些曾经如画的遍布在堡垒周围草地上的鹿已经消失了，为了保护庄稼，这些鹿被捕猎到几乎灭绝。

**Reduction in numbers of game should have boded ill for their survival in later times.** **A worsening of the plight of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land, logging, burning, and clearing, eventually replacing a wilderness landscape with roads, cities, towns, and factories**. No doubt **the numbers of deer declined still further**. Recall the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer, now in a protected status. **But for the black-tailed deer, human pressure has had just the opposite effect**. **Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner**(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington through recorded time, **says that 'since the early 1940s, the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history, the winter population fluctuating around approximately 320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which will yield about 65,000 of either sex and any age annually for an indefinite period.'**

>动物数量的减少为他们以后的生存造成不利的影响。随着定居者侵占土地，伐木，防火，预期鹿的处境将会变得越来越严峻。毫无疑问鹿的数量将会更加降低。但是对于黑尾鹿来说，人类的压力却有着好的影响。HB说自从1940早期，这个州又了比历史上任意一个时期更多的鹿，冬季鹿的数量在大约320000波动，这将无限期的长生大约65000个钟性别的鹿每年。

**The causes of this population rebound are consequences of other human actions.** First, **the major predators of deer**—wolves, cougar, and lynx—**have been greatly reduced in numbers**. Second, **conservation has been insured by limiting times for and types of hunting**. But **the most profound reason for the restoration of high population numbers has been the fate of the forests.** **Great tracts of lowland country** deforested by logging, fire, or both **have become ideal feeding grounds of deer.** In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse, like huckleberry and vine maple, **Arthur Einarsen**, longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest, **found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive.** **The protein content of shade-grown vegetation, for example, was much lower than that for plants grown in clearings.**

>造成这个鹿的数量反弹的原因是其他人类活动。首先鹿的主要捕食者已经被显著的减少了。第二，通过限制狩猎次数和狩猎类型的保护措施得到了保证。但是最有影响的原因是森林的运气。大片的低矮乡村成为了鹿的理想的觅食场地。AE发现在开阔地区的高质量的browse（牧草）更加有营养。例如：遮阴生长的植物的蛋白质含量远低于在开阔地声场的植物中的蛋白质含量
