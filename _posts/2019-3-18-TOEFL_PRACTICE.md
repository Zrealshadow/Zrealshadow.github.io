#### Q1

>A/D: teachers should be paid as much as doctors, lawyers or businessmen. 



A high salary represents this **line of work** is being recognized and appreciated. It has been argued that teachers deserve to be paid as well as doctors, lawyers and businessmen. I think this is not such a bad idea. 

>高薪水代表这个行业被认可尊敬。有人说老师应该拥有和医生，律师，商人同样的收入。我认为着不是一个坏的想法
>
>line of work 这个行业

First, **a decent paycheck** would **enhance teachers’ motivation**. They have to spend hours <u>checking books, studying material and doing research before class to get fully prepared</u>. And right <u>after class there will be questions to be answered and papers to be graded, all of which takes great patience and persistence.</u> Naturally, some may argue that such effort does not **equal to** that of life-saving duties in the ER or evidence-citing moments in the courtroom. But let’s **look at this issue more closely,** education is just equally, if not more, important than other fields. Can you imagine how our children will **turn out to be** if they are being guided by people who don’t take pride in what they do or who think their job is less respectable? Not only can good teachers **impart knowledge**, but they also pass on important values to the next generation. <u>Who can deny the value of an educator who tries to help a juvenile delinquent **get back on track**? And who can **make light of** a teacher who manages to inspire an introvert who **shows promise in** painting to pursue arts?</u> But it cannot be possible without giving these educators due respect and credit. Only when they are **held in high regard** will they start to show a better performance at work. 

>首先，一个体面的收入能够在增加老师的动力, 它们会在检查课本，学习磁疗，做一些研究，做好更充分的课前准备上投入更多的时间。同样下课后也有许多问题需要回答，作业需要批改，所有的这些都要话费很大的耐心和毅力.自然的，有的人可能说这些努力比不上急诊室救人的指责和法庭上审判的时刻。但是让我们仔细看这个问题,教育可能比其他行业同等重要，甚至更重要。你能想想如果你的小孩被一些认为教师职业不被尊敬的人教导，你的小孩最后结果会怎样。老师不仅传授知识，它们带给下一代正确重要的价值观，谁能否认一个努力去帮助少年罪犯回到正轨的教育者的价值呢？谁又能轻视一个试图去激励一个拥有绘画天赋的内向小孩去追寻艺术的老师呢？但是如果不给这些教育者适当的尊敬和信任就不可能实现。 这又当它们被尊重，它们才能开始在工作上表现的更好

Additionally, this policy can help produce a more educated and competent workforce. When teachers receive a salary as much as lawyers and doctors, it sends a positive message to talents who have **excelled in** **all walks of life.** In the past, such talented elites would go for more profitable jobs; but the salary-raising policy would offer them an incentive to take teaching as their profession. In this case, students would learn from the best. <u>A student who **has his heart set on** becoming a lawyer would be thrilled to find that he can learn from someone who had previously made partner in a law firm. And for a young man majoring in medicine, **there’s no better choice than to** have an experienced doctor coach him.</u> <u>Jobs in such highly specialized areas like aerospace engineering, finance and IT all **require extensive knowledge and proper guidance** from a mentor. Without leading experts as teachers, schools **have no hope of** ever **cultivating a competent labor pool**.</u> 

>另外，这项政策也能帮助生产更多的，更有竞争力的劳动力。当老师们接受了和律师，医生同样高的薪水时。这给所有行业中有天赋的人传递了一个积极的消息。在过去，这样的有天赋的精英会找回报更高的工作。但是加薪的政策会给他们刺激去将教书作为他们的主页。在这种情况下，学生们将向最优秀的人学习。一个想成为一名律师的学生，很高兴发现他能向一个曾在律师事务所工作的人学习。对于一个在医学专业的学生来说，没有比一个有经验的医生教导他们更好的事情了。例如高度特别的领域，像航天工程，金融，互联网都需要老师更多的知识和适合的引导。没有顶尖的专家作为老师，学校没有任何希望培养一个有竞争力的劳动资源。

All in all, teachers deserve equally high salaries as their counterparts in other fields like business or medicine, **for the benefits of** their own self- esteem and the educated workforce they can bring to the society. 

>总的来说，老师值得拥有和在其他领域如商业，医学的人的同样高的薪酬。因为他们教育可以带给社会的劳动力。



#### Q2



> A/D: these days children spend more time on doing homework or participating in school-related activities or sports. However, they should be given more time to do whatever they want. 

**Extracurricular activities** are the kind of experience that could **have a good formative impact on** children. Some educators argue that young kids should be given permission to decide how to spend their spare time after school. I think this is a smart move. 

>extracurricular	课外的。extracurricular	课外活动
>
>formative	adj	形成的	have a good formative impact on 对什么有成长上的影响

**To begin with**, after-school activities are supposed to be fun and it wouldn’t **make any sense** unless children are to decide on their own. When schoolwork has already **put much strain on** kids, they would easily **burn out** if they are deprived of the right to do what they want. Some may argue that school-related activities and sports events can also serve as a good way to release stress, but let’s face it, it is next to impossible to **cater to all needs**. Everyone **has their own passion to pursue**. <u>When I was a kid, I was a huge fan of classical music, but instead of taking me to concerts, my folks gave me a soccer and sent me to tryouts. It was a nightmare. I couldn’t sleep at night, feeling so tense and stressed up. Even up to now it still **gives me creeps** when I’**m reminded of** this experience.</u> Only when children spend their spare time on what truly appeals to them can they take a break and **recover from the stress of study**. 

>To bgin with	首先

>recover from the stress of study 从学习的压力中缓过来

Besides, it opens up doors to **limitless possibilities** for children who have a hard time **coping with school**. I know a kid who didn’t do well in school, neither did he show an interest in sports. But he was fascinated by Chinese herb. <u>He would spend hours watching documentaries about traditional Chinese medicine or looking up the original references in the library.</u> His parents never forced him to study **for the sake of school**, but rather they showed great support and even signed him up for an onlinecourse. When he applied for college, he handed in a personal statement that **stood out** instantly. He was later admitted to NYU with a full scholarship because not only does he **show great promise in** medicine, but his one-of-a-kind hobby speaks of novelty and courage. If his parents hadn’t been so open-minded, he would have ended up with a poor grade and a low self-esteem. 

>limitless possibility	无限可能

>cope with school 	应付学校

>
>for the sake of  	为了。。的目的
>
>stand out 	杰出，脱颖而出
>

In a word, apart from schoolwork and sports, children should be encouraged to **follow their heart** and **explore their own interests**. 

>Follow one's heart 追随内心
>
>explore own interests	探索个人兴趣。



### Independent Writing Task



> A/D：Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
>
> Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
>
> Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.



Today, advertising industry is quite persperous and every day we can meet a variety of advertisements. Thus a increasing number of people start to fixate on the regulation and problem of advertisement. In terms of this question, personally, I think that completely forbidding the advertisement towards young children  is too arbitrary. So I disagree upper statement.



Firstly, I should ask everyone do the Television advertisements aim at young children? Let's look that issue closely. the reason why merchants make advertisment is to attach people's attention and make higher profit. Do children aged 2 to 5 have right or money to buy the product? Obviously not. So, essentially, Advertisements' target is couples who have their new babies. So In the Television, the advertisements of baby products like milk, toys and books all telling a story to children's parents about their beneficial to children. There is no advertisement about baby in the market which talks to the children and ask them to buy this products.



Additionally, Some people are concernd about that there might be some advertisments that will do bad influence on their children's growth. In their opinion, children have no capacity of distinguishing the right or wrong things. Let's pay attention to the age. Children aged two to five always do not go to the primary school and even they can not recognize all the alphabet. In that age , the structure of knowledge have not been build, the congnition of their brain have not grow completely. Thus, it is impossible for them to understand the content of advertisements and interprete the desire of advertisements. Some funny advertisement may attract children's eyes and make them happy. It is too exaggerate to say that advertisements may lead these children to the bad way.



Eventually, if all television advertisements about young children are prohibited, Young parents will have defficient information to choose the products for their young children. Although some advertisements may contain exaggeration within the law, the quality of products is basic of advertisements. Having Compared the different characaters of products in advertisement, Parents could pick the most suitable products for their baby. 



To sum up, The truth target of television advertisements to young children is children's parents . Because of the physical limitation of age, children can't be involved in the advertisements.Besides, Advertisements can provide young parents enough information to compare and pick products. Overall, I disagree with upper statement that prohibiting all television advertisements toward young people.

#### Colonizing the Americas via the Northwest Coast

It has long been accepted that the Americas were colonized by a migration of peoples from Asia, slowly traveling across a land bridge called Beringia (now the Bering Strait between northeastern Asia and Alaska) during the last Ice Age. The first water craft theory about this migration was that around 11,000-12,000 years ago there was an ice-free corridor stretching from eastern Beringia to the areas of North America south of the great northern glaciers. It was this midcontinental corridor between two massive ice sheets–the Laurentide to the east and the Cordilleran to the west–that enabled the southward migration. But belief in this ice-free corridor began to crumble when paleoecologist Glen MacDonald demonstrated that some of the most important radiocarbon dates used to support the existence of an ice-free corridor were incorrect. He persuasively argued that such an ice-free corridor did not exist until much later, when the continental ice began its final retreat.

>corridor	n 走廊
>
>crumble  v 崩溃，破裂，使成碎屑
>
>persuasively	adv 有说服力的

>被广泛接受的是美洲曾经被从亚洲来的迁移者殖民，他们缓慢的穿过大陆桥称为白令海峡在最后一个冰季。第一个关于这个迁徙的水上工艺理论大约在11000-12000年之前，又一个没有冰冻的走廊从东方的白令海峡一直延伸到北美冰川以南的北美洲地区。就是这个大陆间的走廊使得向南的迁徙。但是这个无冰走廊的理论开始崩溃当古生态学家GM证明了一些最重要的放射性碳可以用来支持无冰走廊的存在使错误的。他有说服力的论证到这样的无冰走廊直到很久之后，当大陆的冰开始最后的融化后，才存在。

Support is growing for the alternative theory that people using watercraft, possibly skin boats, moved southward from Beringia along the Gulf of Alaska and then southward along the Northwest coast of North America possibly as early as 16,000 years ago. This route would have enabled humans to enter southern areas of the Americas prior to the melting of the continental glaciers. Until the early 1970s,most archaeologists did not consider the coast a possible migration route into the Americas because geologists originally believed that during the last Ice Age the entire Northwest Coast was covered by glacial ice. It had been assumed that the ice extended westward from the Alaskan/Canadian mountains to the very edge of the continental shelf, the flat, submerged part of the continent that extends into the ocean. This would have created a barrier of ice extending from the Alaska Peninsula, through the Gulf of Alaska and southward along the Northwest Coast of north America to what is today the state of Washington.

>submerge 	v	淹没
>
>gulf	n	海湾/深渊

>对于另外一个理论的支持越来越多，人们使用船只从白令海峡向南移动沿着阿拉斯加湾，然后向南沿着北美的西北海岸线，可能早在16000年之前。这个路线可能会是人们进入美国南部地区在大陆冰川融化之前。知道1970年早期，很多考古学家不认为海岸是一个去美洲的可能的迁移路线因为地理学家刚开始相信在最后一个冰世纪整个西北海岸都覆盖着冰川。人们一致认为冰川从阿拉斯加加拿大的山脉向西一直延伸到大陆海岸的边缘，淹没大陆的部分延伸到大海。这将会创造一道冰的屏障，从阿拉斯加半岛一直延伸，沿着阿拉斯加海湾，向南沿着北美的西北海岸一直到今天的华盛顿州。

The most influential proponent of the coastal migration route has been Canadian archaeologist Knut Fladmark. He theorized that with the use of watercraft, people gradually colonized unglaciated refuges and areas along the continental shelf exposed by the lower sea level. Fladmark’s hypothesis received additional support form from the fact that the greatest diversity in native American languages occurs along the west coast of the Americas, suggesting that this region has been settled the longest.

More recent geologic studies documented deglaciation and the existence of ice-free areas throughout major coastal areas of British Columbia, Canada, by 13,000 years ago. Research now indicates that sizable areas of   southeastern Alaska along the inner continental shelf were not covered by ice toward the end of the last Ice Age. One study suggests that except for a 250-mile coastal area between southwestern British Columbia and Washington State, the Northwest Coast of North America was largely free of ice by approximately 16,000 years ago. Vast areas along the coast may have been deglaciated beginning around 16,000 years ago, possibly providing a coastal corridor for the movement of plants, animals, and humans sometime between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago.

>更多最近的地理研究记录了冰消和整个主要海岸线的无冰地区，知道13000年之前。现在研究表明相当大的东南阿拉斯加地区沿着大陆内框架已知道上个冰河时期的末期都没有被冰覆盖。一个资料表明除了250mile海岸线的地区从西南BC到华盛顿州，这个北美的西北海岸大部分都没有被冰覆盖大约在16000年之前。巨大的地区沿着海岸线可能已经冰消了从16000年之前开始。这可能给植物动物人类的移动提供了一条沿海走廊从13000到14000年之前

The coastal hypothesis has gained increasing support in recent years because the remains of large land animals, such as caribou and brown bears, have been found in southeastern Alaska dating between 10,000 and 12,500 years ago. This is the time period in which most scientists formerly believed the area to be inhospitable for humans. It has been suggested that if the environment were capable of supporting breeding populations of bears, there would have been enough food resources to support humans. Fladmark and other believe that the first human colonization of America occurred by boat along the Northwest Coast during the very late Ice Age, possibly as early as 14,000 years ago. The most recent geologic evidence indicates that it may have been possible for people to colonize ice-free regions along the continental shelf that were still exposed by the lower sea level between13,000 and 14,000 years ago.

>海岸假说最近几年已经获得了越来越多的支持，因为一流的大型陆地动物，例如驯鹿，棕熊，已经在阿拉斯加的东南部在10000到12500年之间被发现。 在这段时间中很多科学家以前认为这里不适合人类。有人提出如果环境优能离支持如熊这样的哺乳动物生存繁殖，这就有足够的食物资源去支持人类。F和其他向西第一个美洲殖民者沿着西北海岸划船达到在上个冰河世纪。可能早在14000年之前。最近的地理证据表明人们殖民无冰的地区沿着暴露在13000年到14000年暴露在地海岸线下的大陆框架是有可能的。

The coastal hypothesis suggests an economy based on marine mammal hunting, saltwater fishing, shellfish gathering, and the use of watercraft. Because of the barrier of ice to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and populated areas to the north, there may have been a greater impetus for people to move in a southerly direction.

#### Reflection in Teaching

Teachers, it is thought, benefit from the practice of reflection, the conscious act of thinking deeply about and carefully examining the interactions and events within their own classrooms. Educators T. Wildman and J. Niles (1987) describe a scheme for developing reflective practice in experienced teachers. This was justified by the view that reflective practice could help teachers to feel more intellectually involved in their role and work in teaching and enable them to cope with the paucity of scientific fact and the uncertainty of knowledge in the discipline of teaching.

>conscious 	adj	有意识的/意识到的/神志清醒的
>
>scheme	n	计划/体系/阴谋/结构/方案

>justified	adj	 有正当理由的

>paucity	n	不足

>老师被认为可以从反思行为中获得好处，有意识的深度思考和仔细研究自己课堂中的互动和事件的行为。 教育家TW，JN描述一个培养在有经验的老师中培养反思行为的计划。这是被一个观点所支持，这个观点中反思行为可以帮助老师更智慧的参与到他的位置和教学工作，还能让他们应对科学事实的不足和对于学科教学中知识的不确定性。

Wildman and Niles were particularly interested in investigating the conditions under which reflection might flourish–a subject on which there is little guidance in the literature. They designed an experimental strategy for a group of teachers in Virginia and worked with 40 practicing teachers over several years. They were concerned that many would be “drawn to these new, refreshing”conceptions of teaching only to find that the void between the abstractions and the realities of teacher reflection is too great to bridge. Reflection on a complex task such as teaching is not easy.”The teachers were taken through a program of talking about teaching events, moving on to reflecting about specific issues in a supported, and later an independent, manner.

>void 	n 空虚，空白  v 无效
>
>WN对于调查反思可能发展的条件非常感兴趣。这一主题在其中几乎没有文献的知道。他们设计了一个实验策略对于一群在弗吉尼亚州的一群老师，和40个参与的老师一起工作了几年。他们担心很多老师可能被这种新的新鲜的教学观点所吸引，但是他们发现抽象和现实之间的空白太大而不能联系。在复杂任务例如教学中的反思不是一件容易的事情。老师们通过一个谈论教学活动的计划，继续在支持补贴下反思关于某些问题，之后独立的方式反思。

Wildman and Niles observed that systematic reflection on teaching required a sound ability to understand classroom events in an objective manner. They describe the initial understanding in the teachers with whom they were working as being “utilitarian …and not rich or detailed enough to drive systematic reflection.”Teachers rarely have the time or opportunities to view their own or the teaching of others in an objective manner. Further observation revealed the tendency of teachers to evaluate events rather than review the contributory factors in a considered manner by, in effect, standing outside the situation.

>WN观察系统的教学反思需要一个良好的以客观的方式理解教学实践的良好的能力。他们描述最初的对于和他们一起工作老师的理解，工作作为一个功利主义，不够丰富，详细去推动系统的反思。老师们很少有时间和机会去查看自己活着他人的教学以一个客观的方式。进一步的观察反映出来实际上老师更倾向于评估事件而不是站在环境之外用一个考虑的方式审查这些贡献因素。

Helping this group of teachers to revise their thinking about classroom events became central. This process took time and patience and effective trainers. The researchers estimate that the initial training of the teachers to view events objectively took between 20 and 30 hours, with the same number of hours again being required to practice the skills of reflection.

>revise 	v 	复习修改 
>
>帮助这一群老师修改他们的关于课堂事件的想法变得十分重要。这个过长话费事件和耐心和有效的教练。调查者们估计对于老师们去客观的看待事情的初始训练会花费20到30小时。同样的事件还要被用来联系反思的技巧。

Wildman and Niles identify three principles that facilitate reflective practice in a teaching situation. The first is support from administrators in an education system, enabling teachers to understand the requirements of reflective practice and how it relates to teaching students. The second is the availability of sufficient time and space. The teachers in the program described how they found it difficult to put aside the immediate demands of others in order to give themselves the time they needed to develop their reflective skills. The third is the development of a collaborative environment with support from other teachers. Support and encouragement were also required to help teachers in the program cope with aspects of their professional life with which they were not comfortable. Wildman and Niles make a summary comment: “Perhaps the most important thing we learned is the idea of the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner will not happen simply because it is a good or even compelling idea.”

>facilitate	加速/促进
>
>compelling	adj	应人入胜
>
>WN辨别来三个原则，它们加速反思计划在教育情景中。第一个事教育系统中管理人员的支持，让老师们去理解反思的需要和它怎么联系到教育学生。第二个事足够的时间和空间。这个计划中的老师说他们发现很难去不管现在的其他需求，而去有时间他们去发展他们的反思技巧。第三个是老师支持的合作环境的发展。支持和鼓励是需要的对于帮助这个项目中的老师面对他们职业生涯中不愉快的事情。WN做了一个中介：可能我们学会的最重要的事情是这个老师作为一个反思者的注意不会轻易发生。因为他是一个好的甚至令人着迷的想法。

The work of Wildman and Niles suggests the importance of recognizing some of the difficulties of instituting reflective practice. Others have noted this, making a similar point about the teaching profession’s cultural inhibitions about reflective practice. Zeichner and Liston (1987) point out the inconsistency between the role of the teacher as a (reflective) professional decision maker and the more usual role of the teacher as a technician, putting into practice the ideas of theirs. More basic than the cultural issues is the matter of motivation. Becoming a reflective practitioner requires extra work (Jaworski, 1993) and has only vaguely defined goals with, perhaps, little initially perceivable reward and the threat of vulnerability. Few have directly questioned what might lead a teacher to want to become reflective. Apparently, the most obvious reason for teachers to work toward reflective practice is that teacher educators think it is a good thing. There appear to be many unexplored matters about the motivation to reflect –for example, the value of externally motivated reflection as opposed to that of teachers who might reflect by habit.

>WN的工作表明认识到开始实行反思工作的困难的重要性。其他人也注意到了这一点，提出了类似的观点关于有关反思时间的教师职业文化抑制。ZL指出老师作为一个专业决策者的作用和作为一个技师的更常见的作用之间的前后矛盾性，在执行他们的想法的过程中。比文化问题更基本的是冬季问题。变成一个具有反思的人需要额外的工作，而且最后达成的目标模糊，可能也没有可感知的奖励和脆弱性的威胁。几乎没有人直接问什么可能导致一个拉屎想去变得沉思。显然最明显的原因对于老师来说是以一种反思的方式工作，老师教育者认为这是一件好的事情。似乎有很多没有探索的因素关于驱动反思的原因，例如外在动机的反思价值而不是老师习惯去反思。
