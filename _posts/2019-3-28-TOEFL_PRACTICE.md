### Independent Writing Task



> A/D：Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
>
> Television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
>
> Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.



Today, advertising industry is quite persperous and every day we can meet a variety of advertisements. Thus a increasing number of people start to fixate on the regulation and problem of advertisement. In terms of this question, personally, I think that completely forbidding the advertisement towards young children  is too arbitrary. So I disagree upper statement.



Firstly, I should ask everyone do the Television advertisements aim at young children? Let's look that issue closely. the reason why merchants make advertisment is to attach people's attention and make higher profit. Do children aged 2 to 5 have right or money to buy the product? Obviously not. So, essentially, Advertisements' target is couples who have their new babies. So In the Television, the advertisements of baby products like milk, toys and books all telling a story to children's parents about their beneficial to children. There is no advertisement about baby in the market which talks to the children and ask them to buy this products.



Additionally, Some people are concernd about that there might be some advertisments that will do bad influence on their children's growth. In their opinion, children have no capacity of distinguishing the right or wrong things. Let's pay attention to the age. Children aged two to five always do not go to the primary school and even they can not recognize all the alphabet. In that age , the structure of knowledge have not been build, the congnition of their brain have not grow completely. Thus, it is impossible for them to understand the content of advertisements and interprete the desire of advertisements. Some funny advertisement may attract children's eyes and make them happy. It is too exaggerate to say that advertisements may lead these children to the bad way.



Eventually, if all television advertisements about young children are prohibited, Young parents will have defficient information to choose the products for their young children. Although some advertisements may contain exaggeration within the law, the quality of products is basic of advertisements. Having Compared the different characaters of products in advertisement, Parents could pick the most suitable products for their baby. 



To sum up, The truth target of television advertisements to young children is children's parents . Because of the physical limitation of age, children can't be involved in the advertisements.Besides, Advertisements can provide young parents enough information to compare and pick products. Overall, I disagree with upper statement that prohibiting all television advertisements toward young people.

> A/D: children can benefit a lot from taking care of pets. 



As well as I'am concerned, I definitely agree that children can learn a lot from taking care of pets. This experience will lead to a formative influncen on children's emotinal and mental growth.

Firstly, children will become more tolerant and responsible in solving problems. Personally, these are good qualities to be a good achiever when children reach adulthood. As you can imagine, a puppy just like a baby. Taking care of it is complex and challenging for a young people who almost can't fend themselves. Children will be responsible for bathing them weekly and feeding them periodically. Futhermore, if it has a cold, children even take them to pet hospital for help. Like young parents of a pet, they will try to acquire some professional knowledge to be a good patner of their pets. It is true that children will spend their lots of spare time on attending their pets, resulting in that there is few time remained to other important things. However, seeing the growth of their pet, they will be more achievable. Through this experience, they will be more responsible for what they are assigned to do and more patient when dealing with a challenging problem. I think what they gain is more than what they lose.

Secondly, a pets will be a good friends with their master, which will make children not  alone and help children grow up smoothly. As we all know, among many middle class families , there is alway only one kid in home. Especially in big cities, parents try to work hard to make a living. It is common that children are left alone at home. Obviously, it is not beneficail to children's development. Without supervision and patners, it is possible for children to be involved in wrong hobbies like playing computer games or online romance. However if they have a pet with him , there will be great difference in them. Except attending to their pets in daily life, on weekend, they can wonder around on the street and play frisbee in the park with their bubby. encountering some disappointing things, like bad result of test or punishment of teachers, they can confide to their pets. They know their pets is that they can count on no matter what. When they play with their pets. they can relatively ignore the absence of their parents and feel the beauty of their life.

Eventually, Because of formation of good characteristics and accompany , I agree that children can benefit a lot from taking care of pets.

**A/D：It is much better to take risks and explore new things for older people than younger people.** 

In terms of this statement, a number of people may think it ridiculous. It seems that young people have more time and healther body to support themselve to explore new things and take risks. However, I support this statement. In my opinion,now, older men are better than young men in exploring new things and taking risks.

Firstly, Older men have more resources to support themselves to explore new things and take risks.  They have already accumulated a amount of money from their former work. As we all know, finiance support is the basic of any thing we want to do. If you want to get an accomplishment in economical field, you can invest some potential project or buy some shares from prospective companies. If you want to learn a new language, you will buy some reference books and even go abroad to practice your pronunciation when you are up to certain level.If you have a good idea and you want to achieve it, you can not finish it without help, So you may hire some assistances and establish a firm to manage to do it. Obviously, all of these are full of risks. But , at the same time, there is no denying that all of theses need lots of fund to drive. It is hardly possible for a young men without any background and any assests to do these. 

Secondly, Older men have a better state of mind to face challenge. When they were young, they may be criticized or even fired by their boss because some mistakes in work. They may start a bussiness but end up with failure. They may have to crash up on friends' couch but end up of outstaying themselves welcome.  Several years ago, the old people have get through plenty of awkward situations and also tasted the happiness of achievements. By doing these, they are strong enough to face the wind and rain when exploring new things. With no fluctuations in mind, they can keep calm whether to bump into some obstacls ot to achieve some targets. Compared to old people's state of mind, Emotional and mental growth of young men is needed. It is difficult to pick themselves up when challenge strike them and to keep modest when they take a small step.

Eventually, Someone may think that taking risks and exploring new things are what young men should do. It is completely wrong. Let's look at this issue more closely. Young men have no experience and no money. As a result, They only take risks and explore new things but nothing. It doesn't mean that young men are more suitable to taking challenge than older men. In the contrary, It is better to take risks for older men rather than young men. Life is like a trip to challenging our own limitation. Only with risks and unknown factors is the life more wonderful and fascinating. 

To sum up,Having a good state and sufficient preparation, old people is better to take risks and explore new things than youn men.

> Some people prefer to do exercise alone while others would like group sports. Which do you prefer? 【2015.8.30NA】 



Now, a increasing number of people start to develop a habbit of excercise.Someone like excersie alone , but others prefer to do sport with friends. As for me, I side with the latter view.



Firstly, Group sports can bring more happiness to me than doing exercise alone. Why we still spend our spare time on sports after work with exhausted body ? It is because of the temporary escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life and the relax and ease from excercise that we can ignore the pressure of work and deadline of assignment to continue the excercise. If you work alone in the Gym, without anyone to talk with, it is possible for you to be involved in the trouble of work again. Only by the repeating action and sports perse, you can not escape from the reality temporarily. On the contrary, If you do sports with a group of people, you might pay more attention to the competition. Take the basketball as an example, In order to win and not upset teammate, you will run faster , perfrom actively , and try your best in this activity. It is easeir to forget the problem in the work and life. After a intense competition, you can also confide to your friends and share something wrong, which creates a outlet for pressure.



Secondly, I think people can do group sports with more efficency than alone work. It is common that there is a group of people in gym who put the weight lifting for a while and then go to run for while , can not concentrate on the sports. Eventually these men have done nothing practice but have listened some popular songs. It is just a waste of time. But if you go to gym with friends, there will be a great difference. In you inner heart, you will compare yourself to your friends, so as they do. The invisible competition ,like a supervisor, encourages both of you to try more weightful lifting and longer distance of running. Obviously , it is more efficient than doing exercise alone.

Admittedly, It may be more convenient to work alone. Because you have not to consider you friends schedule and waste time to meet up with your friends before practice. It is all on your own term. However, Let's look at this issue closely. Personally, the essence of working is the happiness from sports. On the one hand, group sports is more effective in bringing happiness than alone excercise. On the other hand, Considering the effeciency of group sport, the time spend on the preparing and organizing is trivial.

Overall, in terms of the question about excersice alone an group spots, I prefer the latter one.





**TPO8 综合写作**

The reading and listening materials have conflict in the opinion about the accuracy of the memoir of Chevalier de Seingalt. The reading material points out some doubts and the listening material show some explaination according to these doubts.



First, the writer points that in the memoir , the Chevalier is very wealthy. but there are some evidence surfaces that the Chevalier borrowed adequate a amount of money from Swiss merchant. Thus , it is a contradiction. In the listening material, the speaker explain that taking assets to Switzerland would cost some time. the Chevalier may used up all his crash and borrowed some money until his own assets arrvial.



Second, the writer has a question about the accuracy of the conversations. in the memoir. Because this memoir was written many years after the conversations accirred. So it is impossible for he to caputure these conversations accurately. In the listening material, the speaker points out that the Chevalier had a habbit in which he would write down some conversation every night. Thus, according to these record, It is not difficult to remember these memory and write down these detailly in memoir.



Eventually, the writer question accuracy of the Chevalier's escaping from a notorious prison in Venice, Italy.  In all critics' view, the description of this escaping is just like novel and not a fact. They point that ti is more likely that the Chevaliers jailers were bribed to free him. However, in the listening meterial, the speaker say that there are more power in the prision. And some evidence of document show that in this prision a ceiling had been repaired in the same time.

So it is a fact in this memoir.

> A/D: in order to attract tourists, government should improve safety by hiring police rather than improve appearance by repairing old buildings and streets.(2015.9.5ML) 

<u>To bring more tourists to the city sounds quite simple, but there has been no single way where the effect can be ensured.</u> Some policy makers believe that mission can be accomplished if government can **ramp up** police security. Sure, safety is clearly important, but I think people will **be better served with** renovation of buildings and streets. 

>ramp up 	加大
>
>be served with 拿。。服务

First off, renovating streets makes the destination accessible to more holiday-makers. No matter how attractive the scenic spot is, without adequate transportation tourists will **be kept at bay**. <u>Inter-city highways, region-connected roads and bus terminals all provide external access to the spot</u>. But the truth is most tourist attractions are far from major urban hubs, and demand plenty of time and money to reach. To **wrestle with jammed traffic** would be **the last thing to expect** for someone on a vacation. So if the government could fund the road renovation program, cabs full of tourists won’t **clog up** the streets. Plus, developing transport links with site-packed itineraries and reducing prices are all tourist-friendly strategies to take the game to the next level. For travelers **on a budget**, affordable road trip would **hold the key to** their choices of destination. 

>accessible 	adj	容易到达/容易理解/容易获得/负担得起
>
>be kept at bay 	寸步难行
>
>Inter-city highway 	城际高速
>
>Region-connected road	地区间公路

>bus terminal	bus站台
>
>hub	枢纽

>wrestle with	全力克服/尽力解决

>jammed traffic	拥挤的交通
>
>be the last thing to expect	最不想看到的事情
>
>clog up	阻塞
>
>on a budget 	生活拮据
>
>hold the key to	对。。很关键

Besides, restoring historical buildings creates new tourist attractions. <u>The recent decades have witnessed a growing number of tourist attractions such as restored temples, reopened silk museums and renovated Imperial Gardens.</u> These sites can not only attract **domestic tourists** but also satisfy the demands of international holiday-makers. <u>Sometimes people build modern skyscrapers, assuming they are going to attract global attention</u>. However, if you take a closer look, you can see that <u>it is not the case for</u> someone who loves to travel. <u>It is buildings with a story to tell and a past to relate to that makes the journey worthwhile</u>. So when government can focus on restoring and refurbishing old buildings we already have, tourists will take a new interest in **checking it out.**

>time witness sth	时间见证
>
>domestic tourist	国内游客
>
>it is not the case for 不是。。的类型
>
>buildings with a story to tell and a past to relate to  有故事有历史的建筑
>
> Check out 看看/结账离开/通过考核/盖章

​	 It is not to say safety issues are **trivial**. **Low crime rate and good social order** do **rank high on the list of** tourist destinations. **After all**, **crime- infested areas** would hardly arouse any interest. <u>Theft, robbery or even terrorist attack would totally ruin the whole trip.</u> But let’s put tourism aside, providing security and fighting against crimes are a fundamental need. <u>It is an obligation government shoulders to guarantee the basic life standards of locals.</u> But **in terms of** boosting tourism, it is the adequate transportation and high-quality tourist attractions that help the government **gain momentum.** 

>Trivial 	adj	不重要
>
>Rank high on the list of sth 	在sth 中非常重要
>
>Low cime rate and good social order 低的犯罪率和好的社会秩序
>
>after all 毕竟
>
>crime-infested area	犯罪横行的地区
>
>in terms of 谈及
>
>gain momentum  取得成果

To sum up, security surely is important, but to **get the local tourism off the ground**, government should **put more weight to** the renovation of old buildings and streets. 

>get sth off the ground 	推动sth，使sth起飞
>
>Put weight to 	重视



>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

>In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at young age.
>
>Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.



In terms of this question, some parents may be opposed to this statement. Because their children are too young to have the ability to manage thier money. However , I view that Learning to manage own money at young age is good method to make children become a financially responsible adults.



First of all, managing their own money can lead children become more self-discipline. As we all known, children have few resistance to the attraction from the delicious food , the good game and the well clothes. When their parents control the finance, they have no money to buy what they want. Once there are a mount of money they can manage for a period time, it is possible for them to run out of these money when they can not resist the outside attractions. In the process of learning to manage money, It is normal to occur. Then these children will get some punishments. After using out of money, they have no rest money to afford the breakfast and the neccesay stationeries. they must suffer from the hungry and starvation. Their teacher will blame them in the class. Even their parents after knowing these things will punish them. Then they will know the bad consequence of their limitless using money. and they will try to insulate the beautiful clothes and close to  their greedy mouth, then make a reasonable decision.



Secondly, managing their own money is a good experience to improve their capacity of management. before this, they have no awareness of how to use a mount of money in a period time. They have to evaluate daily spend and think of how to allocate every parts of it to every day and every things. Even they may make a schedule and record the daily cost in their mobile phone. Additionally, for some particular things in the last days of month, they learn to seperate a mount of money in the beginning. Gradually, they will develop an awareness of saving money. They will plan to eat less or have reduce some entertainment cost to save some money. Maybe after several month, they will use the saving money to exchange a favorable things like musical dishes,  delicate toys or wonderful games. In these process, they have to make their own decisions, consider their own conditions and take actions according to their plans. This is the responsibility to their own finance.



To sum up, through managing own money, children can become more self-discipline and master the management skills well. Thus I definiely suppose upper statement.

> A/D: You need to different to succeed rather than acting like people around you.(2015.9.12ML) 

Success can be perceived and achieved in many different ways. <u>Some people believe being different holds the key while others attribute success to finding common grounds</u>. I’d go for the former view <u>because success depends on knowledge, experience and social circle.</u> 

>perceive 	感知，察觉，把看作
>
>Hold the key 	关键，抓住关键
>
>attribute 	v	把...归咎于某事/认为某物出自 
>
>attribute  success to finding common grounds. 将成功归咎于寻找相同点
>
>social circle 社交圈

First off, <u>the acquisition of knowledge is a matter of individuality</u>. The best problem-solving method **varies from person to person**. A strategy may **work perfectly fine** for one person, but would **turn out to be** **counterproductive** for another. Take my roommate for instance. He **is usually spotted** <u>rushing from library to laboratory, from classroom to tennis court, burning mid-night oil to hit books before finals, and end up with straight A’s through every semester.</u> Taking him as a role model, I started to **follow suit**. I **signed up for** various learning groups and <u>it wasn’t long before I got more than I could handle on my plate and stretched myself too thin</u>, eventually stressed out. It seems to me **working around the clock** may serve him well, but I’d suffer if I **take it too far.** 

>**the acquisition of knowledge** is a matter of individuality 	获得知识使个人问题

>vary from person to person	因人而异

>work around the clock 	24小时工作
>
>take it too far	太过分

Second, there is no single way to success. When taking on a challenge, people who want to make a difference would **think outside the box**, **trying out novel ideas** and **steering away from conventional routines**<u>. As Steve Jobs once put it, innovation distinguishes a leader and a follower</u>. Being different and creative gives you what it takes to **lead the tide**. This **gives them an edge** to rise above the unpredictables. On the other hand, those who imitate and never **bother to** innovate **are bound to be crowded out**. For example, young people **have a tendency to** go abroad to **widen their horizon**s. They believe such experience can cultivate critical thinking and offer different perspectives, which are essential in **opening up job prospects** after graduation. <u>So when you choose a path less traveled, you are more likely to stand out and outshine the ordinary.</u> 

>think outside the box	跳出思维定势
>
>Try out novel ideas	尝试新的想法
>
>steer	v	驾驭	steer away from conventional routines	远离常规
>
>innovation distinguishes a leader and a follower 	创新区分订到这和追随者
>
>lead the tide	引领潮流
>
>give sb an edge	给某人优势

>open up job prospect	打开工作前景 open up prospect
>
>stand out	脱颖而出
>
>outshine 	v 	比...更出色	outshine the ordinary	比平常人更出色



Lastly, people who are different from each other **stand a better chance** of long-lasting relationships. Sure, most people believe **birds of a feather flock together**; people sharing much in common are supposed to get along. But let’s face it, if two hot-tempered friends get into a fight, chances are they’d end up yelling, cursing or even calling names. Neither of them is willing to **budge or meet halfway**. If they **stay mad at** each other, the friendship would probably **get stuck in a dead end**. But if you try to think differently and **stand in the shoes of** your friend, you might **handle the quarrel more properly**. When people realize they are **one of a kind**, so is everybody else, they won’t force their own ideas on others and would **think twice** before offending people that are different from themselves. 

>stand a better chance 	有更好的机会
>
>birds of a feather flock together 	物以类聚，人以群分
>
>chances are	有可能
>
>budge or meet halfway	让步妥协

>stay mad at	对。。感到生气
>
>get stuck in a dead end	陷入死胡同
>
>Stand in the shoes of 	站在…的立场上想想
>
>handle the quarrel more properly	更合理的解决纷争
>
>think they are one of a kind 	认为它们是独一无二的

To sum up, being different offers a unique way of learning, out-of- ordinary experience and better interpersonal relationships, all of which contribute to a more successful life.
